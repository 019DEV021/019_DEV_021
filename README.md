Repository for the Bowling Game coding in Java

**Enviornment and SDK Requirement** You need to install JDK 1.8 or less version in your computer. Insatll Intell J or Ecllipse also.

**Getting Project** Download the project then import or open the project in IDE.

**Code Description** Code logic is built on the below points : -</br>
1.Each game, or “line” of bowling, includes ten turns, or “frames” for the bowler.</br>
2.In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all the pins.</br>
3.If in two tries, he fails to knock them all down, his score for that frame is the total number of pins knocked down in his two tries.</br>
4.If in two tries he knocks them all down, this is called a “spare” and his score for the frame is ten plus the number of pins knocked down on his next throw (in his next turn).</br>
5.If on his first try in the frame he knocks down all the pins, this is called a “strike”. His turn is over, and his score for the frame is ten plus the simple total of the pins knocked down in his next two rolls.</br>
6.If he gets a spare or strike in the last (tenth) frame, the bowler gets to throw one or two more bonus balls, respectively. These bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn. If the bonus throws knock down all the pins, the process does not repeat: the bonus throws are only used to calculate the score of the final frame.</br>
7.The game score is the total of all frame scores.</br>

**Run your downloaded code** You can run the by using IDE (Intellj or Ecllipse) or by using command prompt :</br>
**1.IDE** If you are using any IDE then import the project and RUN the project you will get the output in Console.</br>
**OR**</br>
**2.Command Prompt** If you want to run the program using command prompt , we can but follow the below steps:</br>
**Copy the project and paste it into your C drive**</br>
1.Type cd\ and then hit **Enter**</br>
2.Type **cd 019_DEV_021-master/out/production/BowlingGame** and then hit **Enter**</br>
3.Type **java com.company.Main** and then hit **Enter** </br>
**You will get the output**</br>
